Cultural Activities and Clubs Introduction

With ever changing trends and paradigm shifts in the field of academics, students are continuously looking for new avenues to evolve themselves. Cultural activities and various student clubs are a few options that act as a catalyst in developing technical, managerial, conceptual skills amongst students. Moreover, these activities allow the students to integrate into the institute community especially with the faculties and build a network of mentor and friends. Such involvement enables the students to see the world through wider lenses and understand how to lead the group or get the work done through others. NIT Hamirpur provides a number of such platforms in the forms of clubs to its students to select a club as per his/her likes and channelize their energies in translating their ideas into reality. Some of the key clubs offered by NIT Hamirpur are listed below:

1. Organisation Club

2. Music Club

3. PR Club

4. Dance Club

5. Fine Art Club

6. Discipline Club

7. Technical Club

8. INS & Control Club

9. English Club

10. Decoration Club

11. Hindi Club

12. Informal Club

13. Pixonoids

14. Web Team

15. Dramatics Club

16. SPIC MACAY NIT Hamirpur Student Chapter

The above clubs have been formed with the following objectives:

1. To make the students to participate in the development of the institute and develop their career, personality and organizational skills through interactive programs with the faculty, administration and society.

2. To provide opportunities to NIT Hamirpur students to be involved in culturally enriching activities.

3. To offer a platform to those talented NIT Hamirpur students to extend themselves and grow in their area of hobbies.

4. To expand horizon and inculcate the habit of thinking out of box amongst students with respect to designing their cultural activities.
ANNUAL CULTURAL FEST (HILL FFAIR)

The unison of arts and manifestations of the human intellect is the attribute that makes our country so truly aesthetic and gratifying that one is drawn into the alchemy of its diversities of cultures. With this as its essence, Hill’ffair has carried the badge for being the best cultural extravaganza in the North India and continued to stay true to its grandeur, and that of NIT Hamirpur, with changing time and vogue.

With a humble beginning in 1988, Hill'ffair has gradually emerged to be the institute’s cultural glory and a portal to immerge pioneering ideas and talents from all over the nation culminating in these three days. Enthralling dance choreographies, music performances, concerts, dramatics, national level competitions and numerous cultural events- all, in the dell of the pastoral White Peak mountains and the placid small-town environment-leave no stone unturned in making the festival an unparalleled celebration of culture, education and competition.

Hill’ffair has not only touched and surpassed past benchmarks but created new milestones for the years to come. In 2017, we strived to carry the enthusiasm to the next level. Dedicated to reminiscing and appreciating our cultural roots, the theme for this year was Inception : rediscovering our roots .

With the vision to retrace our journeys to our homelands and reconnect with our traditions and culture, we explored the diversity existing within the college community and delved in the medley held by our country.
Nimbus

NIMBUS is all about students from different branches coming together, forming departmental teams and societies, making technical projects and organising workshops and exhibitions.

About NSS

The National Service Scheme was started to establish a meaningful linkage between the campus and the community. Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation, had recognized that the country could not progress in a desired direction until the student youth were motivated to work for the upliftment of the villages/community. For Gandhiji the villages, where majority of the population lived, represent the country i.e. India. Therefore, for the national reconstruction and national resurgence it was deemed fit that the students and teachers should be properly sensitized and utilized for strengthening the Indian society as a whole with particular emphasis on rural community. Therefore, student youth, teachers and the community are considered the three basic components of the National Service Scheme.


Team OJAS the technical club of Electrical engineering department spread the light of new ideas and enlightens about outstanding technologies available in the field of electricity. It is a part of the annual techfest NIMBUS. Events and exhibits are organized every year with the objective to provide a platform for the students to showcase their talent with a competitive spirit. It is not just about the competitions but also fun events where a lot of those new ideas are seen live.

Before the commencement of main events and exhibitions, workshops are conducted to provide a good grasp of extra knowledge to the students and introduce them to the practical world. Last year workshop on “Arduino and embedded system” was delivered. The idea of organizing a workshop is proven to be successful as it gives an insight into what the club actually does. In addition to workshops, various online events(Fb page) like “quiz-o-mania”, “Matcode” and many more events are equally planned and executed and have managed to gather a maximum response.

“Team Ojas” works with enthusiasm and determination without any hierarchy within the team. We work together in a holistic environment which helps to enhance leadership and team spirit among the members. In NIMBUS 2K17 coordinators, student volunteers and faculty coordinators from April 13th- 15th,2018 organized 6 events including fun events and 12 demonstration projects in the field of electrical and electronics, safety, and protection. The impeccable display of fresh ideas rightly authenticated their credentials. Ideas from students apart from team members are also welcomed and are given a chance to work with the team during the fest.

“Team Ojas” also attracts a lot of crowd with their fun events, like “Laser Tag”,”Electrical Hunt”,” Robotic arm” and “Robo hammer”. There were projects and demonstrations by the team in the field of electricity such as “Self monitoring of energy meter”, “Laser tag”, “Automatic car parking” and also presented a prototype of the “Road surface monitoring system”.The winners were encouraged with cash prizes almost for all the events.

Music finds an important place in the hearts of people of all ages. It is one of the driving factors in our lives. It is what gives us solace in times of sadness, motivation in times of failure, energy in times of exhaustion, and peace in times of chaos. We are here to provide you a fusion of different chords, beats, compositions and melodies of the highest value, which ultimately result in a synergy that is aesthetically pleasing to the ears. Our finest musical works are displayed on various occasions such as Pine Sessions, Open Mic, Nimbus, on various national events like Independence Day and Republic Day. But the main event where you will experience the full force of the Music Club will be none other than on Hill’ffair, the extraordinary cultural fest of NIT-H. We, at the club, are not just a composition of expert vocalists, guitarists and drummers, all huddled up, minding our own business. We are a single united family here, with the aim to bring out the best in each other. It doesn’t matter whether you are a singer, drummer, guitarist, Tabla vadak, or any other instrumentalist. You will always get a chance to put your best foot forward, evoke the inert talent in you, and showcase it in front of the entire college. We strongly believe in perfection, and so every member of our family aspires for perfection. That is why the kind of atmosphere you will be exposed to at the Music Club will motivate you to push yourself beyond your limits and bring out the best in you. And it is ultimately the best work, performed by the best people, that is displayed in front of everybody. Music is not what we do, it’s who we are.

What is the procedure to get into the music club

Hi Karan

There are interviews conducted for every club. You’ll be informed when that happens, so do not worry about that!

As far as the procedure for selecting members goes, each club has different ways to go about it.

If there are any prerequisites or preferences, they will probably be mentioned in the write ups circulated in your class groups when the interview would be announced.


Late Lamyanba Heisnam and Kashish Verma (2014-18 Mechanical batch)- pioneer of robotics culture in NIT Hamirpur.

Their dreams were turned into reality when robotics society was established with their combined efforts in the year 2015 under the able guidance of Prof. Rajesh Sharma. Today we stand as a team is the result of all those hardships they had undergone.

Literacy Mission was established in the winters of 2004. The founders of the Literacy Mission were students of NITH Mr. Amit Sharma, Mr. Aseem Kapoor, and Mr. Ashish Chaudhary, who were distressed at seeing the pitiable conditions of kids who roamed in the campus and fantasized about a life worth living. Literacy Mission started with the vision of adorning the lives of kids residing in nearby slums with a bouquet of education so that their childhood would remain as precious as that of the other children. These kids come from the families labouring at construction sites and most of them are immigrants from different states. Literacy Mission believes that whether you are addressing healthcare, poverty, societal and scientific advancement, human rights, or the livelihoods of individuals, there is no better place to start than with the youth of society and their education. For each and every person, a childhood is an important time, during which one should be able to learn, play, and grow to their heart’s content. We seek to ensure that our children are provided the access to a quality education.Efforts are being made to bring every opportunity to raise them intellectually and enrich their lives.

Initially, the volunteers could not get the rooms for teaching the kids. But soon, with the immense support of some of the faculty members, Literacy Mission was able to get a place to dwell. Classes are conducted at Lecture hall 6 days a week which enrols more than 120 kids, 40 regular volunteers and a total of 100 volunteers. Financial scarcity was one of the major weaknesses with Literacy Mission, but the team fostered the idea of a cultural cum charity festival ‘PRAYAS’-Concert For A Cause” with the purpose of generating funds. There is transparency in Finance and is provided at the official website of Literacy mission NITH . In its focus to groom kids, Literacy Mission has been actively organising various extra curricular activities like drawing and painting competitions, essay writing competition, etc. to make them recognize their talents. General knowledge and presentation based quiz are also organised and rewards are presented to provide them a morale boost up. National and Cultural festivals are celebrated with the aim of bejewelling their lives with a moment of ecstasy.Campus Navigation

The name speaks for itself. we deal with the people. Any colossal event or a fest held in our campus is made possible with extravagant success with our club acting as the backbone that structures it. It has been wisely said that the first impressions are believed to be the last and team PR is the one that gives out the first look of any cultural or technical fest held through copious opportunities like stage handling and anchoring and confronting the vox populi. The theme of the fests held are mostly decided by our team that works at the zenith of its undying potential. With all the suited up gentlemen and the gorgeously dressed up girls, our club never ceases to stand apart from the ‘crowd’. The humongous cheers and never ending claps represent all the diligence and perseverance our club has put in for the event’s success. Numerous colleges participate in our fests held, all invited and called upon by team Public Relations. Special guests and performing bands are called upon and deals are negotiated by the team PR to fill the evening of fests held with vibrant colours and overwhelming euphoria. The performances of clubs are alloted certain specific time slots and performance dates rendered by our team so all clubs have equal time to shine with dazzling glitters. We are the masters of words when it comes to handling and confronting an entire audience in front of us be it anchoring or fillers. Our club knows how to deeply interact with the gathering without being staggering off from the theme. We are not just a team of smart enthusiasts with debonair personalities, rather we are a family that works together as one to make the campus fests shine and bring about success with flying colours.Design & Deco

One for the artists, the painters, the designers who let their brushes paint all canvases with innovation that flows within them. FINE ARTS is the society, or the team behind the beautiful murals and paintings and other artwork you will find yourself appreciating during Hill’fair, our own cultural fest. It’s a fully functional society who carries on its shoulders the responsibility of representing art and artists throughout the college. Like, true artists, they don’t discriminate between the mediums you show your artistic creativity in but support and encourage it.

Our past work is a tremendous testimonial to our talent. The Hill’fair stage is beautifully complemented by large-scale artwork that is designed and created in over a month through the effort of the entire team. Apart from work, the club has an environment of fun and innovation in every activity we undertake. Any artist soul will feel right at home. We wish to see all the new raw talent from the first year to come and try out FINE ARTS. All prerequisites are an inclination towards art and of course, love.

“We began as a team, but have grown into a family.”

Being at NIT H drives us to be a part of the plethora of technical activities, however, the lack of a proper platform to exhibit and hone skills like creative writing, writing travelogues, short stories and poems, in addition to debating, word jamming and extempore led to the creation of Team Tech Gazette.

There is nothing more relaxing than having a group of like-minded people come together and share content, laugh but still manage to productively work together.

We have also brought out our own website where regular updates regarding college events and also, the writing content submitted by you is published. So, if you’re looking for being a part of the social and intellectual excellence, this is the place for you!Robotics Society



WHY WE ARE DIFFERENT:-

Not always you can see past the veil of refined outputs.

Sometimes everything has to be put in a package and delivered as the ultimate result. We do that. We are Team.EXE, We are the departmental team representing the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the Annual Technical Extravaganza of NIT Hamirpur, Nimbus. Each year we strive to raise the bar for technical advancement and showcasing the best of Computer Science and Software Development for anyone to see.

Not only this, we organize many events on the actual three days of Nimbus, which are aimed to provide a fun-filled but still quite informative experience of what Computer Science has to offer. These events range from an online competitive coding competition to an offline debugging race, and a gaming competition too. The members of the teamwork equally hard to be able to brandish the projects as something they’ve contributed to as well as to be a source of unforgettable memories on the Nimbus through the onsite events. The team also gives any of the students that want to display

any or all of their projects an opportunity to present their ideas and applications through the portal of Team.EXE, along with any guidance if required. Also, we aim to provide the freshers an outlook on the world of programming and conduct many pre-nimbus workshops and classes for the first year, most recurrently Linux installation and command line.

Our Vision & Mission :-

Professional as well as Personal growth.

Achieve excellence in Teamwork.

Our Achievements:-

We made an app Paradox, available on Play store that has over 2000 downloads.

The E-cell will be an independent body which will be open to all the students from all the years who aspire to be an entrepreneur.  We will take help from the PM-Yuva scheme which will help us to work on our strength, strengthen our weakness, make use of our opportunities and get rid of our threats.

This scheme will not only help to strengthen our motto of starting our own firm but will help the college to teach the students to be self-employed and be satisfied in the longer run. We also plan on helping the students to change their ideas and thoughts to market ready products. It will also help the students to develop interpersonal skills and public dealing skills which are required for life and not only for being an entrepreneur. Also, our focus will be on teaching the students the problems one faces while starting their own venture and how to tackle them and emerge out successful.INS and Control

Close your eyes. What do you see? Nothing. That’s the Hill’ffair without us. Since the evolution of the Hill’ffair, we are operating as an Event Managing club, coordinating communications among various performing teams and personnel. But our work is not restricted to just a few days of Hill’ffair. Even before Hill’ffair, our finest to simplest members work in union to design posters and videos, for numerous numbers of events.

Our team work in three different areas i.e. backstage, console & projector.

Backstage team- make sure all the performances are on time and requirements are filled.

Console team- manages the audio playbacks

Projector team- displays information of the performances, sponsors in the form of posters & videos.

In these four years in the club, we get many opportunities to build and improve technical skills, teamwork, leadership skills, handling various situations under pressure. We offer organizational support to ensure the process runs smoothly and efficiently.

We work as a team, as a family and strive to cater to the various technical needs before and after Hill’ffair.

On the whole, we are responsible for the perfect execution of Hill’ffair events and hence we are known as ‘Backbone of Hill’ffair’.INS and Control

‘PRAVAH’ the Dramatics Club of NITH is one of the renowned performing clubs of the college. Be it performing on Hill’ffair or participating in India’s largest street play festival “Manthan”, the club has always lived up to the expectation of bringing a change in the society.

With the beginning of every new academic session, the voyage of the club sets its sail for the annual cultural festival Hill’ffair, with the first step being the auditions of new and aspiring Drama enthusiasts and starts preparing for its various acts like choreo, shadow act, play etc.

For recent 3 years, the club has started performing in the cultural festivals of other colleges also like IIT Ropar, DTU, and NSIT and has now become “a whole year active” club, working in both even and odd semesters. Various trips are also organized every year after the completion of annual tasks for the rejuvenation of all members.

A suitable environment is provided for the physical, mental and social growth of each member.

The Dramatics Club gives you an exciting college life with the dull bits cut out.

Under the guidance and support of the faculties, staff, college students and audience, the club is growing day by day and is opting its name ‘PRAVAH’.INS and Control

Bringing the design to life with a wide range of PCB layout tools in EAGLE. Printed circuit board design brings the electronic circuits to life in the physical form. Using layout software, the PCB design process combines component placement and routeing to define electrical connectivity on a manufactured circuit board.

Using ECAD-MCAD integration between EAGLE and Fusion 360 makes it easy to share the PCB design and verify fit in a physical enclosure.

For example, in chemistry, the minimum eigenvalue of a Hermitian matrix characterizing the molecule is the ground state energy of that system. In the future, the quantum phase estimation algorithm may be used to find the minimum eigenvalue. However, its implementation on useful problems requires circuit depths exceeding the limits of hardware available in the NISQ era. In this workshop we will use the VQE algorithm to simulate the ground state energy of a diatomic molecule which is nearly impossible to simulate classically

As the years have progressed, we’ve showcased the perfect blend of science and art by designing dynamic facades, parametric furniture, perforated light fixtures. Handmade models by the students are also exhibited which have been created with the help of various materials, demonstrating technical and architectural skills. Being the best exhibition team of nimbus 2k16, nimbus 2k17and nimbus 2k18, with crowd attracting displays we marked our place in the hearts of NIMBUS. We are waiting to come with more energies and ideas to show in coming years that we are the ” ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-Creativity in the technicality might be the only thing Al wouldn’t be able to touch”.

Events which included Go Tall, in which the participants had to design a stable structure and keep it from falling; furniture designing, where participants were asked to make furniture out of cardboard which could support the weight of an average human being and model making were also organised among other.

Various other activities such as paper crafts, model making and sketching were also included.Nimbus: The Tech Fest xD

Team .EXE

App Team NITH is one of the main technical teams of our college. We work all year round and organize many technical events at various levels.

As the name of our team suggests, our work primarily involves mobile application development, but we do much more than that. We organize hackathons, workshops and promote a coding culture of NITH in general. Yearly, we develop an app during Hill’ffair as well as Nimbus which is the official app for the fest. We also organize workshops on various interesting topics which also include Android App development, Hybrid Apps, Github, Node.js etc. It spreads awareness amidst the students introducing students to many open source concepts. All our projects are open source and anyone within or outside the team can contribute to them. They are readily available on Github for anyone to work on.

During the technical festival Nimbus, an inter-college hackathon, Hack on Hills is organized by App Team NITH, it is one of the biggest technical events of our college involving the participation of teams from various colleges. In its first iteration, more than 25 teams participated and developed various innovative projects.

We would like to welcome anyone who wishes to learn and contribute to the team.IN4MALS

Hill’ffair: Cultural Fest :o


“Do it big, Do it right, And do it with style”

“Once a dancer, forever a dancer”

Dancing not only rejuvenates us but teaches the importance of discipline, coordination, teamwork, hard work and makes you popular of course 😛

Dance is what makes  you lose your being and still make you feel alive, what makes you dissolve yourself in the rhythm of your heartbeats, when it seems that each tap of the foot and each twirl you make creates the beats that everyone  listens.

Here at Rhythmeecz, the Dance Club of NIT Hamirpur, we unleash our energy and madness, and create wondrous visual treats for the audience. We dance like it’s the best day of our lives and we grind like we were made to do nothing but dance. Each performance has the audience in shrieks and cheering, coz we create the fiercest moves.

We are the primary highlight of our cultural fest and many other events and also perform in competitions in other colleges like IIT Delhi, IIT Ropar, NIT Kurukshetra, DTU etc.

Join us if you have the passion to perform and if you wish to feel the exhilaration of the stage.Bhangra Crew

GLUG-NITH  is the open source community of NITH, founded more than a decade ago.  The prime motive of GLUG is to help promote use of open source software, free distribution of these software and spreading awareness regarding open source contributions. We are a heterogeneous mixture of people ranging from the beta testers and kernel hackers to the fresh-faced newbies, held together by a common love for GNU/Linux in particular and Free Software in general.

GLUG-NITH welcomes anyone to be a part of the team and volunteer in our prime event, Software Freedom Day, celebrated yearly. It involves open source software distribution and installation, presentations on such software and a talk about Google Summer of Code and other open source internships, where people introduce their organization, share their experiences of contributing on an open source platform and guide us how to do the same.

GLUG is also primarily responsible for spreading a vibrant GSOC culture in NITH.

We want the people to learn, install, work & experiment with free and open source software and use them in their day-to-day lives.App Team NITH
