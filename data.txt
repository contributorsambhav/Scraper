Moreover, these activities allow the students to integrate into the institute community especially with the faculties and build a network of mentor and friends. Such involvement enables the students to see the world through wider lenses and understand how to lead the group or get the work done through others. NIT Hamirpur provides a number of such platforms in the forms of clubs to its students to select a club as per his/her likes and channelize their energies in translating their ideas into reality.

With this as its essence, Hill’ffair has carried the badge for being the best cultural extravaganza in the North India and continued to stay true to its grandeur, and that of NIT Hamirpur, with changing time and vogue.With a humble beginning in 1988, Hill'ffair has gradually emerged to be the institute’s cultural glory and a portal to immerge pioneering ideas and talents from all over the nation culminating in these three days. Enthralling dance choreographies, music performances, concerts, dramatics, national level competitions and numerous cultural events- all, in the dell of the pastoral White Peak mountains and the placid small-town environment-leave no stone unturned in making the festival an unparalleled celebration of culture, education and competition.Hill’ffair has not only touched and surpassed past benchmarks but created new milestones for the years to come. In 2017, we strived to carry the enthusiasm to the next level. Dedicated to reminiscing and appreciating our cultural roots, the theme for this year was Inception : rediscovering our roots .With the vision to retrace our journeys to our homelands and reconnect with our traditions and culture, we explored the diversity existing within the college community and delved in the medley held by our country.NimbusNIMBUS is all about students from different branches coming together, forming departmental teams and societies, making technical projects and organising workshops and exhibitions.

Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation, had recognized that the country could not progress in a desired direction until the student youth were motivated to work for the upliftment of the villages/community. For Gandhiji the villages, where majority of the population lived, represent the country i.e. India. Therefore, for the national reconstruction and national resurgence it was deemed fit that the students and teachers should be properly sensitized and utilized for strengthening the Indian society as a whole with particular emphasis on rural community. Therefore, student youth, teachers and the community are considered the three basic components of the National Service Scheme.Skip to contentMENUOpen SearchTeam OJAS the technical club of Electrical engineering department spread the light of new ideas and enlightens about outstanding technologies available in the field of electricity.

Bringing smile on a child’s face gives the deepest satisfaction that cannot be verbalized . “=aLiteracy Mission was established in the winters of 2004. The founders of the Literacy Mission were students of NITH Mr. Amit Sharma, Mr. Aseem Kapoor, and Mr. Ashish Chaudhary, who were distressed at seeing the pitiable conditions of kids who roamed in the campus and fantasized about a life worth living. Literacy Mission started with the vision of adorning the lives of kids residing in nearby slums with a bouquet of education so that their childhood would remain as precious as that of the other children. These kids come from the families labouring at construction sites and most of them are immigrants from different states. Literacy Mission believes that whether you are addressing healthcare, poverty, societal and scientific advancement, human rights, or the livelihoods of individuals, there is no better place to start than with the youth of society and their education. For each and every person, a childhood is an important time, during which one should be able to learn, play, and grow to their heart’s content. We seek to ensure that our children are provided the access to a quality education.Efforts are being made to bring every opportunity to raise them intellectually and enrich their lives.Initially, the volunteers could not get the rooms for teaching the kids. But soon, with the immense support of some of the faculty members, Literacy Mission was able to get a place to dwell. Classes are conducted at Lecture hall 6 days a week which enrols more than 120 kids, 40 regular volunteers and a total of 100 volunteers. Financial scarcity was one of the major weaknesses with Literacy Mission, but the team fostered the idea of a cultural cum charity festival ‘PRAYAS’-Concert For A Cause” with the purpose of generating funds. There is transparency in Finance and is provided at the official website of Literacy mission NITH . In its focus to groom kids, Literacy Mission has been actively organising various extra curricular activities like drawing and painting competitions, essay writing competition, etc. to make them recognize their talents. General knowledge and presentation based quiz are also organised and rewards are presented to provide them a morale boost up. National and Cultural festivals are celebrated with the aim of bejewelling their lives with a moment of ecstasy.SHARE THIS:TwitterFacebookRELATEDCampus NavigationAugust 21, 2018In "Anything and Everything"Design & DecoAugust 22, 2018In "Anything and Everything"HAM Radio SocietyAugust 22, 2018In "Anything and Everything"Leave a commentWrite a comment...Log in or provide your name and email to leave a comment.Email me new postsInstantlyDailyWeeklyEmail me new commentsSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.CommentSearch for:CATEGORIESAnything and Everything (63)Campus Navigation And Map (1)Credits (1)Departmental Teams (11)Fests (3)GeeksForGeeks (3)Hill'ffair Clubs (19)Hostels (3)How To…!?

The performances of clubs are alloted certain specific time slots and performance dates rendered by our team so all clubs have equal time to shine with dazzling glitters. We are the masters of words when it comes to handling and confronting an entire audience in front of us be it anchoring or fillers.
