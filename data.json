Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation, had recognized that the country could not progress in a desired direction until the student youth were motivated to work for the upliftment of the villages/community. For Gandhiji the villages, where majority of the population lived, represent the country i.e. India. Therefore, for the national reconstruction and national resurgence it was deemed fit that the students and teachers should be properly sensitized and utilized for strengthening the Indian society as a whole with particular emphasis on rural community. Therefore, student youth, teachers and the community are considered the three basic components of the National Service Scheme.",

It is a part of the annual techfest NIMBUS. Events and exhibits are organized every year with the objective to provide a platform for the students to showcase their talent with a competitive spirit. It is not just about the competitions but also fun events where a lot of those new ideas are seen live.\n\nBefore the commencement of main events and exhibitions, workshops are conducted to provide a good grasp of extra knowledge to the students and introduce them to the practical world. Last year workshop on “Arduino and embedded system” was delivered. The idea of organizing a workshop is proven to be successful as it gives an insight into what the club actually does. In addition to workshops, various online events(Fb page) like “quiz-o-mania”, “Matcode” and many more events are equally planned and executed and have managed to gather a maximum response.\n\n“Team Ojas” works with enthusiasm and determination without any hierarchy within the team. We work together in a holistic environment which helps to enhance leadership and team spirit among the members. In NIMBUS 2K17 coordinators, student volunteers and faculty coordinators from April 13th- 15th,2018 organized 6 events including fun events and 12 demonstration projects in the field of electrical and electronics, safety, and protection. The impeccable display of fresh ideas rightly authenticated their credentials. Ideas from students apart from team members are also welcomed and are given a chance to work with the team during the fest.\n\n“Team Ojas” also attracts a lot of crowd with their fun events, like “Laser Tag”,”Electrical Hunt”,” Robotic arm” and “Robo hammer”. There were projects and demonstrations by the team in the field of electricity such as “Self monitoring of energy meter”, “Laser tag”, “Automatic car parking” and also presented a prototype of the “Road surface monitoring system”.The winners were encouraged with cash prizes almost for all the events.\n\nSHARE THIS:\n\nTwitterFacebook\n\nRELATED\n\nNimbus: The Tech Fest xD\n\nAugust 21, 2018\n\nIn \"Anything and Everything\"\n\nTeam .EXE\n\nAugust 22, 2018\n\nIn \"Anything and Everything\"\n\nTeam C Helix\n\nAugust 22, 2018\n\nIn \"Anything and Everything\"\n\nLeave a comment\n\nWrite a comment...\n\nLog in or provide your name and email to leave a comment.\n\nEmail me new posts\n\nInstantly\n\nDaily\n\nWeekly\n\nEmail me new comments\n\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n\nComment\n\nSearch for:\n\nCATEGORIES\n\nAnything and Everything (63)\n\nCampus Navigation And Map (1)\n\nCredits (1)\n\nDepartmental Teams (11)\n\nFests (3)\n\nGeeksForGeeks (3)\n\nHill'ffair Clubs (19)\n\nHostels (3)\n\nHow To…!?

Bringing smile on a child’s face gives the deepest satisfaction that cannot be verbalized . “=a\n\nLiteracy Mission was established in the winters of 2004. The founders of the Literacy Mission were students of NITH Mr. Amit Sharma, Mr. Aseem Kapoor, and Mr. Ashish Chaudhary, who were distressed at seeing the pitiable conditions of kids who roamed in the campus and fantasized about a life worth living. Literacy Mission started with the vision of adorning the lives of kids residing in nearby slums with a bouquet of education so that their childhood would remain as precious as that of the other children. These kids come from the families labouring at construction sites and most of them are immigrants from different states. Literacy Mission believes that whether you are addressing healthcare, poverty, societal and scientific advancement, human rights, or the livelihoods of individuals, there is no better place to start than with the youth of society and their education. For each and every person, a childhood is an important time, during which one should be able to learn, play, and grow to their heart’s content. We seek to ensure that our children are provided the access to a quality education.Efforts are being made to bring every opportunity to raise them intellectually and enrich their lives.\n\nInitially, the volunteers could not get the rooms for teaching the kids. But soon, with the immense support of some of the faculty members, Literacy Mission was able to get a place to dwell. Classes are conducted at Lecture hall 6 days a week which enrols more than 120 kids, 40 regular volunteers and a total of 100 volunteers. Financial scarcity was one of the major weaknesses with Literacy Mission, but the team fostered the idea of a cultural cum charity festival ‘PRAYAS’-Concert For A Cause” with the purpose of generating funds. There is transparency in Finance and is provided at the official website of Literacy mission NITH .

Special guests and performing bands are called upon and deals are negotiated by the team PR to fill the evening of fests held with vibrant colours and overwhelming euphoria. The performances of clubs are alloted certain specific time slots and performance dates rendered by our team so all clubs have equal time to shine with dazzling glitters. We are the masters of words when it comes to handling and confronting an entire audience in front of us be it anchoring or fillers. Our club knows how to deeply interact with the gathering without being staggering off from the theme. We are not just a team of smart enthusiasts with debonair personalities, rather we are a family that works together as one to make the campus fests shine and bring about success with flying colours.\n\nSHARE THIS:\n\nTwitterFacebook\n\nRELATED\n\nDesign & Deco\n\nAugust 22, 2018\n\nIn \"Anything and Everything\"\n\nINS and Control\n\nAugust 22, 2018\n\nIn \"Anything and Everything\"\n\nIN4MALS\n\nAugust 22, 2018\n\nIn \"Anything and Everything\"\n\nLeave a comment\n\nWrite a comment...\n\nLog in or provide your name and email to leave a comment.\n\nEmail me new posts\n\nInstantly\n\nDaily\n\nWeekly\n\nEmail me new comments\n\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n\nComment\n\nSearch for:\n\nCATEGORIES\n\nAnything and Everything (63)\n\nCampus Navigation And Map (1)\n\nCredits (1)\n\nDepartmental Teams (11)\n\nFests (3)\n\nGeeksForGeeks (3)\n\nHill'ffair Clubs (19)\n\nHostels (3)\n\nHow To…!?

FINE ARTS is the society, or the team behind the beautiful murals and paintings and other artwork you will find yourself appreciating during Hill’fair, our own cultural fest. It’s a fully functional society who carries on its shoulders the responsibility of representing art and artists throughout the college. Like, true artists, they don’t discriminate between the mediums you show your artistic creativity in but support and encourage it.\n\nOur past work is a tremendous testimonial to our talent. The Hill’fair stage is beautifully complemented by large-scale artwork that is designed and created in over a month through the effort of the entire team. Apart from work, the club has an environment of fun and innovation in every activity we undertake. Any artist soul will feel right at home. We wish to see all the new raw talent from the first year to come and try out FINE ARTS.
