With this as its essence, Hill’ffair has carried the badge for being the best cultural extravaganza in the North India and continued to stay true to its grandeur, and that of NIT Hamirpur, with changing time and vogue.With a humble beginning in 1988, Hill'ffair has gradually emerged to be the institute’s cultural glory and a portal to immerge pioneering ideas and talents from all over the nation culminating in these three days. Enthralling dance choreographies, music performances, concerts, dramatics, national level competitions and numerous cultural events- all, in the dell of the pastoral White Peak mountains and the placid small-town environment-leave no stone unturned in making the festival an unparalleled celebration of culture, education and competition.Hill’ffair has not only touched and surpassed past benchmarks but created new milestones for the years to come. In 2017, we strived to carry the enthusiasm to the next level. Dedicated to reminiscing and appreciating our cultural roots, the theme for this year was Inception : rediscovering our roots .With the vision to retrace our journeys to our homelands and reconnect with our traditions and culture, we explored the diversity existing within the college community and delved in the medley held by our country.NimbusNIMBUS is all about students from different branches coming together, forming departmental teams and societies, making technical projects and organising workshops and exhibitions.

Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation, had recognized that the country could not progress in a desired direction until the student youth were motivated to work for the upliftment of the villages/community. For Gandhiji the villages, where majority of the population lived, represent the country i.e. India. Therefore, for the national reconstruction and national resurgence it was deemed fit that the students and teachers should be properly sensitized and utilized for strengthening the Indian society as a whole with particular emphasis on rural community. Therefore, student youth, teachers and the community are considered the three basic components of the National Service Scheme.Skip to contentMENUOpen SearchTeam OJAS the technical club of Electrical engineering department spread the light of new ideas and enlightens about outstanding technologies available in the field of electricity.

Bringing smile on a child’s face gives the deepest satisfaction that cannot be verbalized . “=aLiteracy Mission was established in the winters of 2004. The founders of the Literacy Mission were students of NITH Mr. Amit Sharma, Mr. Aseem Kapoor, and Mr. Ashish Chaudhary, who were distressed at seeing the pitiable conditions of kids who roamed in the campus and fantasized about a life worth living. Literacy Mission started with the vision of adorning the lives of kids residing in nearby slums with a bouquet of education so that their childhood would remain as precious as that of the other children. These kids come from the families labouring at construction sites and most of them are immigrants from different states. Literacy Mission believes that whether you are addressing healthcare, poverty, societal and scientific advancement, human rights, or the livelihoods of individuals, there is no better place to start than with the youth of society and their education. For each and every person, a childhood is an important time, during which one should be able to learn, play, and grow to their heart’s content. We seek to ensure that our children are provided the access to a quality education.Efforts are being made to bring every opportunity to raise them intellectually and enrich their lives.Initially, the volunteers could not get the rooms for teaching the kids. But soon, with the immense support of some of the faculty members, Literacy Mission was able to get a place to dwell. Classes are conducted at Lecture hall 6 days a week which enrols more than 120 kids, 40 regular volunteers and a total of 100 volunteers. Financial scarcity was one of the major weaknesses with Literacy Mission, but the team fostered the idea of a cultural cum charity festival ‘PRAYAS’-Concert For A Cause” with the purpose of generating funds. There is transparency in Finance and is provided at the official website of Literacy mission NITH . In its focus to groom kids, Literacy Mission has been actively organising various extra curricular activities like drawing and painting competitions, essay writing competition, etc. to make them recognize their talents. General knowledge and presentation based quiz are also organised and rewards are presented to provide them a morale boost up. National and Cultural festivals are celebrated with the aim of bejewelling their lives with a moment of ecstasy.SHARE THIS:TwitterFacebookRELATEDCampus NavigationAugust 21, 2018In "Anything and Everything"Design & DecoAugust 22, 2018In "Anything and Everything"HAM Radio SocietyAugust 22, 2018In "Anything and Everything"Leave a commentWrite a comment...Log in or provide your name and email to leave a comment.Email me new postsInstantlyDailyWeeklyEmail me new commentsSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.CommentSearch for:CATEGORIESAnything and Everything (63)Campus Navigation And Map (1)Credits (1)Departmental Teams (11)Fests (3)GeeksForGeeks (3)Hill'ffair Clubs (19)Hostels (3)How To…!?

The institution has carved a niche for itself amongst the top ranking institutes of the country by making big strides along multiple dimensions. The Vision and Mission statement of the Institute is true manifestation what we venture to achieve in our day to day working at NIT Hamirpur. The quality of our students in the market is a clear depiction of our untiring and exhaustive efforts. The availability of best possible resources, including human resource, to the students is our top priority. Our experienced, qualified and motivated faculty has proved its excellence in achieving the assigned goal. In the current phase of total urbanized atmosphere the NIT Hamirpur Campus is like a breath of fresh air in the lap of lush green pine trees and has picturesque view of Dhauladhar mountain ranges. All this provides excellent academic ambience and living environment. It is totally a ragging free campus and the Institute has developed an environment of zero tolerance of ragging with the active support of faculty, administration and the student body, in keeping with the requisite norms. My sincere advice to new entrants is to enjoy the beautiful campus environment of NIT Hamirpur and make best use of the facilities provided for their welfare. Under no circumstances a student is supposed to indulge in any unlawful activity during his/her stay, and any such case will not be tolerated. The publication of NIT Hamirpur regulations to curb the menace of ragging is a unique storehouse of information on the directives issued by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India, the MHRD, as well as actions taken by the Institute in this regard. | hope that the students will spend their valuable time productively, shape their career excellently, uphold the ideals of good learning, value the pursuit of merit imbibed in the annals of the institute and earn laurels for themselves, their families and the institution. Prof. Hiralal Murlidhar Suryawanshi Director, NIT Hamirpur Message from the Dean (Student Welfare) | wish to congratulate the parents of the students admitted to NIT Hamirpur for deciding and choosing to study in the beautiful campus of NIT Hamirpur. It is the hard work of these newcomers, that has led them to get admitted in one of the most sought NITs i.e. NIT Hamirpur. The Student Welfare section looks after the welfare of students in the Institute, their conduct, discipline, seriousness to studies, health, scholarships, functioning of Hostels, promoting corporate community living and self-management including management of kitchen, mess and dining hall through team of wardens and chief wardens, NCC and NSS programmes , coordination through Fl{student activities) for Literary activities, Cultural activities, technical activities, entrepreneurial activities, sports, games etc. organized by various Societies for all round personality development of students etc. We provide ample opportunities to our students for developing extracurricular skills. The Institute has a large sports ground, an open air theatre, indoor sports facilities, Lawn Tennis, Billiard and Gymnasium separate for girl & boy students. The Institute houses 11 hostels including 4 hostels for girls. NIT Hamirpur is a ragging free campus providing 0% tolerance on the issue. It is my sincere request to the parents of students to advise their wards not to indulge in ragging directly or indirectly. For the convenience of the students anti-ragging hoardings are displayed in the campus at all the sensitive locations displaying the mobile numbers of all the institute authorities and district administration to curb the menace of ragging inside the institute. The students must report any ragging incidence to the hostel staff (mess attendants, mess manager, hostel wardens) or to Chief Warden/ Dean (SW). The Institute has put the flying squads on duty in the hostels to curb the menace of ragging. An empowered Anti-ragging Committee has been constituted as per UGC guidelines to take strict action in case any student is found involved in ragging activity. The students are requested not to hide such incidences, which may lead to exponential rise in ragging cases. On behalf of the NIT Hamirpur, | once again urge the senior students not to indulge in such activities. Dr. Ashok Kumar Dean (Student Welfare) NIT Hamirpur INDEX Sr.No. Particulars Page No. 1.

Preface In the highly competitive environment of today, it is not unusual for students to experience personal, social or academic problems in their day to day life. National Institute of Technology Hamirpur is committed to support the students and recognizes the importance of a student's health and wellbeing in relation to his/her progression in the personal and academic life. To meet this end, Student Counselling Cell has been established to help the students in ‘solving their problems related to personal, social, psychological or academics, etc., so that they are able to achieve academic excellence, develop an integrated personality during their stay in the campus. The counselling services cover all bachelor, master and doctoral students, with particular emphasis on improving academic performance of academically deficient students. The Counselling Cell is headed by Associate Dean (Discipline & Counselling) under the directions of Dean (Student Welfare). With the approval of Director, a Counselling Committee is constituted to proving counselling service to the students. This Committee is assisted by Students Committee comprising one student representative from each department/centre. For general counselling, students can approach Dean (Student Welfare) and the team members. By maintaining the confidentiality of all types, the student will be counseled by internal team and if needed may be supported by external agencies. 2. Common Issues Seeking Counselling i. Personal Concerns: Relationship issues, linguistic barriers, low self-esteem, parent/peer pressure, etc. ii. Behavioral Concerns: Dominance, complexes (superiority and inferiority), anxiety, anger, frustration, eating issues, depression, etc. ii, Academic Concerns: Examination failure, irregular attendance, extra semesters, placement, career anxiety, disciplinary issues/action, research stagnation, interview preparation, etc. iv. Socio-Cultural/Ethical Concems: Social awkwardness, decision making, value and beliefs practices, etc. v. Addiction Concerns: Alcohol, substance use, smoking, excessive use of mobiles/media, etc. vi. Grief and Trauma Concerns: Loss of loved one, natural disaster, pandemic/endemic like COVID-19, etc. Strategies to Address Counselling Issues A. The Context and Role of the Counselling Service i. The Institute recognizes that a student's wellbeing and his/her progression in the personal and academic life is very important for the Institute and Nation. It is recognized that the pressures on young people can affect their mental health and wellbeing, and that young people in education can experience high levels of stress and change, and be extremely vulnerable. i. Counselling is a form of psychological or talking therapy that offers people a chance to change how they feel and to live better. iii. The key task of the Institute is the education of its students, and implicit in this statement is the understanding that students work more effectively in a supportive environment which encourages personal development and autonomy. Students who feel in control of their personal lives are more likely to achieve educationally and contribute to the overall success of the Institute. yn op tO OO vi. vil. vili. C. Students seek service from the Counselling Cell for many reasons. These services may be having an impact on their wellbeing, or they may have observed a distinct change in their conduct/behavior and emotion at home, Institute or in their social lives. Examples of presenting issues are bereavement, anxiety, stress, personal and family relationships, personal and sexual identity, eating problems, self-harm, bullying and anger management. Some students seek help due to unresolved issues since their childhood such as physical or sexual abuse, or neglect. Others seek help as they are having suicidal thoughts or have made a suicide attempt. The counselling services provide students with a support at a time when they are most vulnerable and aim to contain the distress of vulnerable students. However, the counselling service cannot take responsibility for all mental health issues arising in the Institute and will work together with other key staff to support students in distressing situations. Counselling aims to help students, through individual or group work, to feel they are in control of their own lives, able to make choices and decisions, and to put them into action. It also allows the student to talk through past events and to come to a greater understanding of them. Counselling offers the opportunity for the student to talk and be heard in a safe, non-judgmental environment. NIT Hamirpur plays the role in this process to facilitate the student's personal development. The counselor/counselling team will not usually give advice but will help the student find their own answers. Having said this, psycho-education is playing an increasingly bigger part in counselling, empowering students with knowledge around certain psychological theories and self-help interventions, Counselors/counselling team may carry out other tasks including delivering workshops to students and staff on topics including anti-bullying, self-esteem, relaxation or anger management. The counselling team also offers group mediation to students and staff to enable parties to find a resolution to a conflict. Counselors may also liaise with external agencies and maintain links with these to support the wellbeing of students. Entitlement to Counselling The counselling service is available to all students of NIT Hamirpur. However, in order to maintain professional and ethical boundaries, students who also stay at UG, PG and PhD level can take the support of multiple programs related to counselling. The students seeking counselling during the Institute vacations or while being away from the campus, may refer to appropriate external agencies. Confidentiality The ethical framework of NIT Hamirpur will expect that the counselling team offers the highest possible levels of confidentiality in order to respect the student's privacy and create the trust necessary for counselling. Counselling sessions are confidential to the student. Unless they have the student's prior consent, the counselor will not pass on to a third party any information regarding a student's attendance, their presenting issues or their ongoing issues. However, in exceptional circumstances the counselor may take the decision to break confidentiality, with or without the student's consent, if necessary wherein his/her professional judgment: there is a risk of the student seriously harming himself/herself there is a risk of another person being harmed there is a risk of a serious crime being committed +2 Afr \e7 a ee D. Counselling Service Delivery The Counselling Service operates in consultation with Associate Dean (Student Discipline & Counselling) and shall offer the following: E: One-to-one counselling by appointment. For an appointment, a student is free to approach at any time during working hours. Institute may arrange mediation sessions for the students with the help of different spiritual and professional agencies. Workshops for students on various topics such as anger management, self-esteem, relaxation, fitness regime, educational exposures and methods to improve academic performance. Email and WhatsApp support to students for counselling. Referring into the Service Students can self-refer or may be referred by teaching or support staff.

One needs to develop the competence to make ethical and value-added decisions and should be directed toward institutional commitment. It consists of two major components (i) Quality of Teaching and (ii) Contribution towards the generation of knowledge (Research) and these two aspects should be pursued together. Those who choose this path with a selfless attitude have found success and every goal fulfilled. The NITH needs to set a benchmark in terms of student satisfaction level, several publications, citations, awards, sponsored projects, institutional management, extension activities, revenue generation, etc. Today the quality of publications and citations is measured by converting them into business propositions like patents, copyrights, involvement in national development activities, etc. The National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur (HP) is providing many facilities for the students and faculty to engage themselves in re- search activities. The Institute has quality research labs, where the students and faculty take forward their research activities. The research work of faculty and students is well accepted in national and inter- national forums. The research publications are mostly in SCI, SCIE, Scopus, Web of Science indexed Journals and Conferences. Faculty members have also written/ edited books and book chapters under various National as well as International publishing houses.
