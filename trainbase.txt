Cultural Activities and Clubs Introduction
With ever changing trends and paradigm shifts in the field of academics, students are continuously looking for new avenues to evolve themselves. Cultural activities and various student clubs are a few options that act as a catalyst in developing technical, managerial, conceptual skills amongst students. Moreover, these activities allow the students to integrate into the institute community especially with the faculties and build a network of mentor and friends. Such involvement enables the students to see the world through wider lenses and understand how to lead the group or get the work done through others. NIT Hamirpur provides a number of such platforms in the forms of clubs to its students to select a club as per his/her likes and channelize their energies in translating their ideas into reality. Some of the key clubs offered by NIT Hamirpur are listed below:
1. Organisation Club
2. Music Club
3. PR Club
4. Dance Club
5. Fine Art Club
6. Discipline Club
7. Technical Club
8. INS & Control Club
9. English Club
10. Decoration Club
11. Hindi Club
12. Informal Club
13. Pixonoids
14. Web Team
15. Dramatics Club
16. SPIC MACAY NIT Hamirpur Student Chapter
The above clubs have been formed with the following objectives:
1. To make the students to participate in the development of the institute and develop their career, personality and organizational skills through interactive programs with the faculty, administration and society.
2. To provide opportunities to NIT Hamirpur students to be involved in culturally enriching activities.
3. To offer a platform to those talented NIT Hamirpur students to extend themselves and grow in their area of hobbies.
4. To expand horizon and inculcate the habit of thinking out of box amongst students with respect to designing their cultural activities.
ANNUAL CULTURAL FEST (HILL FFAIR)
The unison of arts and manifestations of the human intellect is the attribute that makes our country so truly aesthetic and gratifying that one is drawn into the alchemy of its diversities of cultures. With this as its essence, Hill’ffair has carried the badge for being the best cultural extravaganza in the North India and continued to stay true to its grandeur, and that of NIT Hamirpur, with changing time and vogue.
With a humble beginning in 1988, Hill'ffair has gradually emerged to be the institute’s cultural glory and a portal to immerge pioneering ideas and talents from all over the nation culminating in these three days. Enthralling dance choreographies, music performances, concerts, dramatics, national level competitions and numerous cultural events- all, in the dell of the pastoral White Peak mountains and the placid small-town environment-leave no stone unturned in making the festival an unparalleled celebration of culture, education and competition.
Hill’ffair has not only touched and surpassed past benchmarks but created new milestones for the years to come. In 2017, we strived to carry the enthusiasm to the next level. Dedicated to reminiscing and appreciating our cultural roots, the theme for this year was Inception : rediscovering our roots .
With the vision to retrace our journeys to our homelands and reconnect with our traditions and culture, we explored the diversity existing within the college community and delved in the medley held by our country.
Nimbus
NIMBUS is all about students from different branches coming together, forming departmental teams and societies, making technical projects and organising workshops and exhibitions. In other words, students working for Nimbus gain knowledge about all sorts of technologies around, couple it with hands on experience and spread it around the campus for all other students to learn.
Student Discipline Board

About NSS
The National Service Scheme was started to establish a meaningful linkage between the campus and the community. Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation, had recognized that the country could not progress in a desired direction until the student youth were motivated to work for the upliftment of the villages/community. For Gandhiji the villages, where majority of the population lived, represent the country i.e. India. Therefore, for the national reconstruction and national resurgence it was deemed fit that the students and teachers should be properly sensitized and utilized for strengthening the Indian society as a whole with particular emphasis on rural community. Therefore, student youth, teachers and the community are considered the three basic components of the National Service Scheme.
Team OJAS the technical club of Electrical engineering department spread the light of new ideas and enlightens about outstanding technologies available in the field of electricity. It is a part of the annual techfest NIMBUS. Events and exhibits are organized every year with the objective to provide a platform for the students to showcase their talent with a competitive spirit. It is not just about the competitions but also fun events where a lot of those new ideas are seen live.
Before the commencement of main events and exhibitions, workshops are conducted to provide a good grasp of extra knowledge to the students and introduce them to the practical world. Last year workshop on “Arduino and embedded system” was delivered. The idea of organizing a workshop is proven to be successful as it gives an insight into what the club actually does. In addition to workshops, various online events(Fb page) like “quiz-o-mania”, “Matcode” and many more events are equally planned and executed and have managed to gather a maximum response.
“Team Ojas” works with enthusiasm and determination without any hierarchy within the team. We work together in a holistic environment which helps to enhance leadership and team spirit among the members. In NIMBUS 2K17 coordinators, student volunteers and faculty coordinators from April 13th- 15th,2018 organized 6 events including fun events and 12 demonstration projects in the field of electrical and electronics, safety, and protection. The impeccable display of fresh ideas rightly authenticated their credentials. Ideas from students apart from team members are also welcomed and are given a chance to work with the team during the fest.
“Team Ojas” also attracts a lot of crowd with their fun events, like “Laser Tag”,”Electrical Hunt”,” Robotic arm” and “Robo hammer”. There were projects and demonstrations by the team in the field of electricity such as “Self monitoring of energy meter”, “Laser tag”, “Automatic car parking” and also presented a prototype of the “Road surface monitoring system”.The winners were encouraged with cash prizes almost for all the events.
“Not a club, but a team.”

It is what gives us solace in times of sadness, motivation in times of failure, energy in times of exhaustion, and peace in times of chaos. We are here to provide you a fusion of different chords, beats, compositions and melodies of the highest value, which ultimately result in a synergy that is aesthetically pleasing to the ears. Our finest musical works are displayed on various occasions such as Pine Sessions, Open Mic, Nimbus, on various national events like Independence Day and Republic Day. But the main event where you will experience the full force of the Music Club will be none other than on Hill’ffair, the extraordinary cultural fest of NIT-H. We, at the club, are not just a composition of expert vocalists, guitarists and drummers, all huddled up, minding our own business. We are a single united family here, with the aim to bring out the best in each other. It doesn’t matter whether you are a singer, drummer, guitarist, Tabla vadak, or any other instrumentalist. You will always get a chance to put your best foot forward, evoke the inert talent in you, and showcase it in front of the entire college. We strongly believe in perfection, and so every member of our family aspires for perfection.

What is the procedure to get into the music club
Hi Karan
There are interviews conducted for every club. You’ll be informed when that happens, so do not worry about that!
As far as the procedure for selecting members goes, each club has different ways to go about it.
If there are any prerequisites or preferences, they will probably be mentioned in the write ups circulated in your class groups when the interview would be announced.
Late Lamyanba Heisnam and Kashish Verma (2014-18 Mechanical batch)- pioneer of robotics culture in NIT Hamirpur.

Literacy Mission was established in the winters of 2004. The founders of the Literacy Mission were students of NITH Mr. Amit Sharma, Mr. Aseem Kapoor, and Mr. Ashish Chaudhary, who were distressed at seeing the pitiable conditions of kids who roamed in the campus and fantasized about a life worth living. Literacy Mission started with the vision of adorning the lives of kids residing in nearby slums with a bouquet of education so that their childhood would remain as precious as that of the other children. These kids come from the families labouring at construction sites and most of them are immigrants from different states. Literacy Mission believes that whether you are addressing healthcare, poverty, societal and scientific advancement, human rights, or the livelihoods of individuals, there is no better place to start than with the youth of society and their education. For each and every person, a childhood is an important time, during which one should be able to learn, play, and grow to their heart’s content. We seek to ensure that our children are provided the access to a quality education.Efforts are being made to bring every opportunity to raise them intellectually and enrich their lives.
Initially, the volunteers could not get the rooms for teaching the kids. But soon, with the immense support of some of the faculty members, Literacy Mission was able to get a place to dwell. Classes are conducted at Lecture hall 6 days a week which enrols more than 120 kids, 40 regular volunteers and a total of 100 volunteers. Financial scarcity was one of the major weaknesses with Literacy Mission, but the team fostered the idea of a cultural cum charity festival ‘PRAYAS’-Concert For A Cause” with the purpose of generating funds. There is transparency in Finance and is provided at the official website of Literacy mission NITH . In its focus to groom kids, Literacy Mission has been actively organising various extra curricular activities like drawing and painting competitions, essay writing competition, etc. to make them recognize their talents. General knowledge and presentation based quiz are also organised and rewards are presented to provide them a morale boost up. National and Cultural festivals are celebrated with the aim of bejewelling their lives with a moment of ecstasy.Campus Navigation

The name speaks for itself. we deal with the people. Any colossal event or a fest held in our campus is made possible with extravagant success with our club acting as the backbone that structures it. It has been wisely said that the first impressions are believed to be the last and team PR is the one that gives out the first look of any cultural or technical fest held through copious opportunities like stage handling and anchoring and confronting the vox populi. The theme of the fests held are mostly decided by our team that works at the zenith of its undying potential. With all the suited up gentlemen and the gorgeously dressed up girls, our club never ceases to stand apart from the ‘crowd’. The humongous cheers and never ending claps represent all the diligence and perseverance our club has put in for the event’s success. Numerous colleges participate in our fests held, all invited and called upon by team Public Relations. Special guests and performing bands are called upon and deals are negotiated by the team PR to fill the evening of fests held with vibrant colours and overwhelming euphoria. The performances of clubs are alloted certain specific time slots and performance dates rendered by our team so all clubs have equal time to shine with dazzling glitters. We are the masters of words when it comes to handling and confronting an entire audience in front of us be it anchoring or fillers. Our club knows how to deeply interact with the gathering without being staggering off from the theme. We are not just a team of smart enthusiasts with debonair personalities, rather we are a family that works together as one to make the campus fests shine and bring about success with flying colours.Design & Deco
One for the artists, the painters, the designers who let their brushes paint all canvases with innovation that flows within them. FINE ARTS is the society, or the team behind the beautiful murals and paintings and other artwork you will find yourself appreciating during Hill’fair, our own cultural fest. It’s a fully functional society who carries on its shoulders the responsibility of representing art and artists throughout the college. Like, true artists, they don’t discriminate between the mediums you show your artistic creativity in but support and encourage it.
Our past work is a tremendous testimonial to our talent. The Hill’fair stage is beautifully complemented by large-scale artwork that is designed and created in over a month through the effort of the entire team. Apart from work, the club has an environment of fun and innovation in every activity we undertake. Any artist soul will feel right at home. We wish to see all the new raw talent from the first year to come and try out FINE ARTS. All prerequisites are an inclination towards art and of course, love.

“We began as a team, but have grown into a family.”
Being at NIT H drives us to be a part of the plethora of technical activities, however, the lack of a proper platform to exhibit and hone skills like creative writing, writing travelogues, short stories and poems, in addition to debating, word jamming and extempore led to the creation of Team Tech Gazette.
There is nothing more relaxing than having a group of like-minded people come together and share content, laugh but still manage to productively work together.
We have also brought out our own website where regular updates regarding college events and also, the writing content submitted by you is published. So, if you’re looking for being a part of the social and intellectual excellence, this is the place for you!Robotics Society
WHY WE ARE DIFFERENT:-
Not always you can see past the veil of refined outputs.
Sometimes everything has to be put in a package and delivered as the ultimate result. We do that. We are Team.EXE, We are the departmental team representing the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the Annual Technical Extravaganza of NIT Hamirpur, Nimbus. Each year we strive to raise the bar for technical advancement and showcasing the best of Computer Science and Software Development for anyone to see. When it comes to projects, we take up projects that are helpful to the students and thus result in a smooth life for the students in the
college; and we finish them using a corporate protocol of deadlines and online version control. Not only this, we organize many events on the actual three days of Nimbus, which are aimed to provide a fun-filled but still quite informative experience of what Computer Science has to offer. These events range from an online competitive coding competition to an offline debugging race, and a gaming competition too. The members of the teamwork equally hard to be able to brandish the projects as something they’ve contributed to as well as to be a source of unforgettable memories on the Nimbus through the onsite events. The team also gives any of the students that want toimport { promises as fs } from 'fs';

The latest entry to the clubs is the Entrepreneurship Club which is a non-performing club and will be active throughout the year. It plans on the formation of the E-cell which will conduct various activities showcasing the problems which one faces while starting a start-up. The E-cell will be an independent body which will be open to all the students from all the years who aspire to be an entrepreneur.  We will take help from the PM-Yuva scheme which will help us to work on our strength, strengthen our weakness, make use of our opportunities and get rid of our threats.
This scheme will not only help to strengthen our motto of starting our own firm but will help the college to teach the students to be self-employed and be satisfied in the longer run. We also plan on helping the students to change their ideas and thoughts to market ready products. It will also help the students to develop interpersonal skills and public dealing skills which are required for life and not only for being an entrepreneur. Also, our focus will be on teaching the students the problems one faces while starting their own venture and how to tackle them and emerge out successful.INS and Control

Close your eyes. What do you see? Nothing. That’s the Hill’ffair without us. Since the evolution of the Hill’ffair, we are operating as an Event Managing club, coordinating communications among various performing teams and personnel. But our work is not restricted to just a few days of Hill’ffair. Even before Hill’ffair, our finest to simplest members work in union to design posters and videos, for numerous numbers of events.
Our team work in three different areas i.e. backstage, console & projector.
Backstage team- make sure all the performances are on time and requirements are filled.
Console team- manages the audio playbacks
Projector team- displays information of the performances, sponsors in the form of posters & videos.
In these four years in the club, we get many opportunities to build and improve technical skills, teamwork, leadership skills, handling various situations under pressure. We offer organizational support to ensure the process runs smoothly and efficiently.
We work as a team, as a family and strive to cater to the various technical needs before and after Hill’ffair.
On the whole, we are responsible for the perfect execution of Hill’ffair events and hence we are known as ‘Backbone of Hill’ffair’.INS and Control

Bringing the design to life with a wide range of PCB layout tools in EAGLE. Printed circuit board design brings the electronic circuits to life in the physical form. Using layout software, the PCB design process combines component placement and routeing to define electrical connectivity on a manufactured circuit board.
Using ECAD-MCAD integration between EAGLE and Fusion 360 makes it easy to share the PCB design and verify fit in a physical enclosure.

In many applications it is important to find the minimum eigenvalue of a matrix. For example, in chemistry, the minimum eigenvalue of a Hermitian matrix characterizing the molecule is the ground state energy of that system. In the future, the quantum phase estimation algorithm may be used to find the minimum eigenvalue. However, its implementation on useful problems requires circuit depths exceeding the limits of hardware available in the NISQ era. In this workshop we will use the VQE algorithm to simulate the ground state energy of a diatomic molecule which is nearly impossible to simulate classically

Hill’ffair: Cultural Fest :o
“Do it big, Do it right, And do it with style”
“Once a dancer, forever a dancer”
Dancing not only rejuvenates us but teaches the importance of discipline, coordination, teamwork, hard work and makes you popular of course 😛
Dance is what makes  you lose your being and still make you feel alive, what makes you dissolve yourself in the rhythm of your heartbeats, when it seems that each tap of the foot and each twirl you make creates the beats that everyone  listens.
Here at Rhythmeecz, the Dance Club of NIT Hamirpur, we unleash our energy and madness, and create wondrous visual treats for the audience. We dance like it’s the best day of our lives and we grind like we were made to do nothing but dance. Each performance has the audience in shrieks and cheering, coz we create the fiercest moves.
We are the primary highlight of our cultural fest and many other events and also perform in competitions in other colleges like IIT Delhi, IIT Ropar, NIT Kurukshetra, DTU etc.
Join us if you have the passion to perform and if you wish to feel the exhilaration of the stage.Bhangra Crew

Anti-Ragging Compendium (2024-25)
NIT HAMIRPUR REGULATIONS
TO CURB THE MENACE OF RAGGING
(Session 2024-25)
OUR VISION
“To build a vibrant multicultural learning environment founded on value
based academic principles, wherein all involved shall contribute
effectively, efficiently and responsibly to the nation and global
community.”
Message from the Director
At the outset, I extend warm welcome to the new entrants to National Institute of
Technology, Hamirpur (Himachal Pradesh). The institution has carved a niche for itself amongst the top ranking institutes of the country by making big strides along multiple dimensions. The Vision and Mission statement of the Institute is true manifestation what we venture to achieve in our day to day working at NIT Hamirpur. The quality of our students in the market is a clear depiction of our untiring and exhaustive efforts. The availability of best possible resources, including human resource, to the students is our top priority. Our experienced, qualified and motivated faculty has proved its excellence in
achieving the assigned goal.
In the current phase of total urbanized atmosphere the NIT Hamirpur Campus is likea breath of fresh air in the lap of lush green pine trees and has picturesque view ofDhauladhar mountain ranges. All this provides excellent academic ambience and livingenvironment. It is totally a ragging free campus and the Institute has developed anenvironment of zero tolerance of ragging with the active support of faculty, administrationand the student body, in keeping with the requisite norms. My sincere advice to newentrants is to enjoy the beautiful campus environment of NIT Hamirpur and make best useof the facilities provided for their welfare. Under no circumstances a student is supposed toindulge in any unlawful activity during his/her stay, and any such case will not be tolerated.
The publication of NIT Hamirpur regulations to curb the menace of ragging is a uniquestorehouse of information on the directives issued by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India,the MHRD, as well as actions taken by the Institute in this regard.
I hope that the students will spend their valuable time productively, shape their
career excellently, uphold the ideals of good learning, value the pursuit of merit imbibed in the annals of the institute and earn laurels for themselves, their families and the institution.
Prof. Hiralal Murlidhar Suryawanshi
Director, NIT Hamirpur
Message from the Dean (Student Welfare)
I wish to congratulate the parents of the students admitted to NIT Hamirpur for deciding and choosing to study in the beautiful campus of NIT Hamirpur. It is the hard work of these newcomers, that has led them to get admitted in one of the most sought NITs i.e. NIT Hamirpur.
The Student Welfare section looks after the welfare of students in the Institute, their conduct, discipline,seriousness to studies, health, scholarships, functioning of Hostels, promoting corporate community livingand self-management including management of kitchen, mess and dining hall through team of wardensand chief wardens, NCC and NSS programmes , coordination through Fl{student activities) for Literaryactivities, Cultural activities, technical activities, entrepreneurial activities, sports, games etc. organized byvarious Societies for all round personality development of students etc.
We provide ample opportunities to our students for developing extracurricular skills. The Institute has alarge sports ground, an open air theatre, indoor sports facilities, Lawn Tennis, Billiard and Gymnasiumseparate for girl & boy students. The Institute houses 11 hostels including 4 hostels for girls.
NIT Hamirpur is a ragging free campus providing 0% tolerance on the issue. It is my sincere request to theparents of students to advise their wards not to indulge in ragging directly or indirectly. For theconvenience of the students anti-ragging hoardings are displayed in the campus at all the sensitivelocations displaying the mobile numbers of all the institute authorities and district administration to curb themenace of ragging inside the institute. The students must report any ragging incidence to the hostel staff(mess attendants, mess manager, hostel wardens) or to Chief Warden/ Dean (SW). The Institute has putthe flying squads on duty in the hostels to curb the menace of ragging. An empowered Anti-raggingCommittee has been constituted as per UGC guidelines to take strict action in case any student is foundinvolved in ragging activity. The students are requested not to hide such incidences, which may lead toexponential rise in ragging cases. On behalf of the NIT Hamirpur, I once again urge the senior students not to indulge in such activities.

National Institute of Technology Hamirpur
Students Counselling Cell
1. Preface
In the highly competitive environment of today, it is not unusual for students to experience personal, social or academic problems in their day to day life. National Institute of Technology Hamirpur is committed to support the students and recognizes the importance of a student's health and wellbeing in relation to his/her progression in the personal and academic life. To meet this end, Student Counselling Cell has been established to help the students in ‘solving their problems related to personal, social, psychological or academics, etc., so that they are able to achieve academic excellence, develop an integrated personality during their stay in the campus.
The counselling services cover all bachelor, master and doctoral students, with particular emphasis on improving academic performance of academically deficient students. The Counselling Cell is headed by Associate Dean (Discipline & Counselling) under the directions of Dean (Student Welfare). With the approval of Director, a Counselling Committee is constituted to proving counselling service to the students. This Committee is assisted by Students Committee comprising one student representative from each department/centre. For general counselling, students can approach Dean (Student Welfare) and the team members. By maintaining the confidentiality of all types, the student will be counseled by internal team and if needed may be supported by external agencies.
2. Common Issues Seeking Counselling
i. Personal Concerns: Relationship issues, linguistic barriers, low self-esteem, parent/peer pressure, etc.
ii. Behavioral Concerns: Dominance, complexes (superiority and inferiority), anxiety, anger, frustration, eating
issues, depression, etc.
ii, Academic Concerns: Examination failure, irregular attendance, extra semesters, placement, career anxiety,
disciplinary issues/action, research stagnation, interview preparation, etc.
iv. Socio-Cultural/Ethical Concems: Social awkwardness, decision making, value and beliefs practices, etc.
v. Addiction Concerns: Alcohol, substance use, smoking, excessive use of mobiles/media, etc.
vi. Grief and Trauma Concerns: Loss of loved one, natural disaster, pandemic/endemic like COVID-19, etc.
Strategies to Address Counselling Issues
A. The Context and Role of the Counselling Service
i. The Institute recognizes that a student's wellbeing and his/her progression in the personal and academic life is very important for the Institute and Nation. It is recognized that the pressures on young people can affect their mental health and wellbeing, and that young people in education can experience high levels of stress and change, and be extremely vulnerable.
i. Counselling is a form of psychological or talking therapy that offers people a chance to change how they feel and to live better.
iii. The key task of the Institute is the education of its students, and implicit in this statement is the understanding that students work more effectively in a supportive environment which encourages personal development and autonomy. Students who feel in control of their personal lives are more likely to achieve educationally and contribute to the overall success of the Institute.
 
Students seek service from the Counselling Cell for many reasons. These services may be having an impact on their wellbeing, or they may have observed a distinct change in their conduct/behavior and emotion at home, Institute or in their social lives. Examples of presenting issues are bereavement, anxiety, stress, personal and family relationships, personal and sexual identity, eating problems, self-harm, bullying and anger management. Some students seek help due to unresolved issues since their childhood such as physical or sexual abuse, or neglect. Others seek help as they are having suicidal thoughts or have made a suicide attempt.
The counselling services provide students with a support at a time when they are most vulnerable and aim to contain the distress of vulnerable students. However, the counselling service cannot take responsibility for all mental health issues arising in the Institute and will work together with other key staff to support students in distressing situations.
Counselling aims to help students, through individual or group work, to feel they are in control of their own lives, able to make choices and decisions, and to put them into action. It also allows the student to talk through past events and to come to a greater understanding of them. Counselling offers the opportunity for the student to talk and be heard in a safe, non-judgmental environment. NIT Hamirpur plays the role in this process to facilitate the student's personal development.
The counselor/counselling team will not usually give advice but will help the student find their own answers. Having said this, psycho-education is playing an increasingly bigger part in counselling, empowering students  ith knowledge around certain psychological theories and self-help interventions,
Counselors/counselling team may carry out other tasks including delivering workshops to students and staff on topics including anti-bullying, self-esteem, relaxation or anger management.
The counselling team also offers group mediation to students and staff to enable parties to find a resolution to a conflict.
Counselors may also liaise with external agencies and maintain links with these to support the wellbeing of students.
Entitlement to Counselling
The counselling service is available to all students of NIT Hamirpur. However, in order to maintain professional and ethical boundaries, students who also stay at UG, PG and PhD level can take the support of multiple programs related to counselling. The students seeking counselling during the Institute vacations or while being away from the campus, may refer to appropriate external agencies.
Confidentiality
The ethical framework of NIT Hamirpur will expect that the counselling team offers the highest possible levels of confidentiality in order to respect the student's privacy and create the trust necessary for counselling.
Counselling sessions are confidential to the student. Unless they have the student's prior consent, the counselor will not pass on to a third party any information regarding a student's attendance, their presenting issues or their ongoing issues.
However, in exceptional circumstances the counselor may take the decision to break confidentiality, with or without the student's consent, if necessary wherein his/her professional judgment:
there is a risk of the student seriously harming himself/herself
there is a risk of another person being harmed
there is a risk of a serious crime being committed
Counselling Service Delivery
The Counselling Service operates in consultation with Associate Dean (Student Discipline & Counselling) and shall offer the following:
One-to-one counselling by appointment. For an appointment, a student is free to approach at any time during working hours.
Institute may arrange mediation sessions for the students with the help of different spiritual and professional agencies. Workshops for students on various topics such as anger management, self-esteem, relaxation, fitness regime, educational exposures and methods to improve academic performance.
Email and WhatsApp support to students for counselling.
Referring into the Service
Students can self-refer or may be referred by teaching or support staff.
Students can be referred directly or through the Student Services Help Desk.
The counselling service will initially offer session to the seeker. If a student still requires further support, he/she may be referred to an external service.
Students will arrange their sessions outside the class times.
institute counselors develop and maintain an effective network of internal and external referral agencies and  efer students as appropriate and wherein their best interest.
Record Keeping
The Counselling Cell of Dean (Student Welfare) aims to prepare database of all the students studying at NIT Hamirpur and will keep record of the contact details of their parents/guardians. Each student studying at NIT Hamirpur may be contacted on regular basis by Counselling Cell through bulk messaging services.
Regarding counselling, a special care will be taken to maintain the record in a confidential manner.

RESEARCH & PROJECTS
In the present context, where globalization has become a reality, one needs to have autonomy with accountability. One needs to develop the competence to make ethical and value-added decisions and should be directed toward institutional commitment. It consists of two major components
(i) Quality of Teaching and (ii) Contribution towards the generation of knowledge (Research) and these two aspects should be pursued together. Those who choose this path with a selfless attitude have found success and every goal fulfilled. The NITH needs to set a benchmark in terms of student satisfaction level, several publications, citations, awards, sponsored projects, institutional management, extension activities, revenue generation, etc. Today the quality of publications and citations is measured by converting them into business propositions like patents, copyrights, involvement in national development activities, etc. The National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur (HP) is providing many facilities for the students and faculty to engage themselves in re- search activities. The Institute has quality research labs, where the students and faculty take forward their research activities. The research work of faculty and students is well accepted in national and inter- national forums.
The research publications are mostly in SCI, SCIE, Scopus, Web of Science indexed Journals and Conferences. Faculty members have also written/edited books and book chapters under various National as well as International publishing houses.
