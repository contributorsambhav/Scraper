One needs to develop the competence to make ethical and value-added decisions and should be directed toward institutional commitment. It consists of two major components (i) Quality of Teaching and (ii) Contribution towards the generation of knowledge (Research) and these two aspects should be pursued together. Those who choose this path with a selfless attitude have found success and every goal fulfilled. The NITH needs to set a benchmark in terms of student satisfaction level, several publications, citations, awards, sponsored projects, institutional management, extension activities, revenue generation, etc. Today the quality of publications and citations is measured by converting them into business propositions like patents, copyrights, involvement in national development activities, etc. The National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur (HP) is providing many facilities for the students and faculty to engage themselves in re- search activities. The Institute has quality research labs, where the students and faculty take forward their research activities. The research work of faculty and students is well accepted in national and inter- national forums. The research publications are mostly in SCI, SCIE, Scopus, Web of Science indexed Journals and Conferences. Faculty members have also written/ edited books and book chapters under various National as well as International publishing houses.
